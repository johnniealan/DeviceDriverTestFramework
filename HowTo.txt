Stage 1: Compiling Framework
============================
a. Copy the Entire Folder in ubunutu machine where arm tool chain is configured
b. Goto to the folder "DeviceDrvTstFW/mak"
c. Issue "make all host=arm" to cross compile for arm platform. "make all" for i686 platform
d. check in "DeviceDrvTstFW/bin" if "testFW" is created

Stage 2: Compiling Test cases
=============================
a. All the test cases are present in the folder "DeviceDrvTstFW/testcases".
b. The demo test cases are pre-compiled along with framework.
c. To compile your device driver specific test cases, say for instance "High Speed ArcNET". Got to folder "DeviceDrvTstFW/testcases/hsArcNetTestCases".
d. Issue "make all host=arm"
e. The test cases will be compiled into "DeviceDrvTstFW/bin" as "masterHSArcnetTstCase.so" and "slaveHSArcnetTstCase.so" 

Stage 3: Executing Test cases in Arm based system
=================================================
a. Copy "DeviceDrvTstFW/bin" folder to Router.
b. Update the PATH variable to add this bin folder Example: If bin folder is copied to /home/root, then export PATH=/home/root/bin:${PATH}
c. Execute testFW, with appropriate options.
d. The results will be stored in bin and the debug file will be created in bin folder to store information for debugging.
